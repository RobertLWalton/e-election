\section{Introduction}

Our purpose is to specify an all-electronic election system
suitable for replacing the current optical paper system
used in Massachusetts.  Our system is based on the notion
of `tamper proof software', which is software that is
known to do what it should do.

\section{Outline}

A Private Voting Machine
(PVM) is constructed from a single thumb drive and a
registration card.  Part of the thumb drive contains the
tamper proof software of the PVM, part contains an encryped
data set called a Voter Lock Box (V-Box), and the registration
card contains a passkey that is entered on the keyboard in
order to decrypt/encrypt the V-Box.  The software runs on
a (fairly) arbitrary computer, is bootstrapped directly,
runs without using any operating system or BIOS,
uses only RAM memory during operation,
writes the encryped V-Box back to the thumb drive, and sends
a very few encrypted messages to other `machines' in the
system.

The other machines are the Registration Machines, which make
ready-to-mark ballots available and time-stamp and certify
encrypted finished ballots; the Collection Machines that collect
finished ballots; and the Counting Machines that count the
ballots.  Each machine has the same design as the PVM, except
these other machines are each run by a election officials, and
each are replicated with different officials running different
replicas.  Each Counting Machine also uses separate
thumb drives containing master lock boxes
(M-Boxes), and requires 5 out of 10 election officials to cooperatively
provide decrypted M-Boxes in order to decrypt ballots and
produce final counts.

Each Machine as a public key and a private key (or in the
case of a Counting Machine, 10 private keys).  Each precinct
has its own separate set of Counting Machines and M-Boxes with
private keys.
