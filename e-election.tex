\section{Introduction}

Our purpose is to specify an all-electronic election E-Election System
suitable for replacing the current optical paper system
used in Massachusetts.  Our system is based on the notion
of `tamper proof software', which is software that is
known to do what it should do.

\section{Outline}

A Private Voting Machine
(PVM) is constructed from a single thumb drive and a
registration card.  Part of the thumb drive contains the
tamper proof software of the PVM, part contains an encryped
data set called a Voter Lock Box (V-Box), and the registration
card contains a passkey that is entered on the keyboard in
order to decrypt/encrypt the V-Box.  The software runs on
a (fairly) arbitrary computer, is bootstrapped directly,
runs without using any operating system or BIOS,
uses only RAM memory during operation,
writes the encryped V-Box back to the thumb drive, and sends
a very few encrypted messages to other `machines' in the
system.

The other machines are the Registration Machines, which make
ready-to-mark ballots available and time-stamp and certify
encrypted finished ballots; the Collection Machines that collect
finished ballots; and the Counting Machines that count the
ballots.  Each machine has the same design as the PVM, except
these other machines have different software,
are each run by a single election official instead of a voter, and
are replicated with different officials running different
replicas.  Counting Machines also use separate
thumb drives containing master lock boxes
(M-Boxes), and a Counting Machine requires
5 out of 10 election officials to cooperatively
provide decrypted M-Boxes in order to decrypt ballots and
produce final counts.

Each Machine and each M-Box has a public key and a private key.
Each precinct has its own separate set of Counting Machines and M-Boxes,
but precincts may share Collection Machines and Registration
Machines.

Collection Machines,
Counting Machines, and M-Boxes may be
specific to a particular election, but Registration Machines
and Private Voting Machines and
their public keys are shared across multiple elections.

\section{Advantages}

The main advantages of the E-Election System are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Substantially reduced election staff manpower.
\item Substantially decreased cost of running an election.
\item Substantially increased ease of voting.
\end{enumerate}

Hopefully these advantages will eventually lead to
greater voter turnout and more frequent use of elections such
as referendums to let the voters decide issues directly
(as is done in Switzerland).


\section{Tamper Proof Software}

Tamper Proof Software is software written in a `tamper proof'
programming language
that has the following property:
\begin{indpar}
The translation of souce code to binary files is so precisely
specified that several independent groups of programmers can
write compilers that will produce identical binaries from any
given source.
\end{indpar}

Clearly a sufficiently simple assembly language qualifies, but
we need a somewhat higher level language.  Still, such a language
should be possible.  Two aids to this end are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Computer efficiency is not required in this application.

\item
If two compilers disagree on some source, the matter can be
investigated, and either one or both compilers fixed, or the
language specification improved.
\end{enumerate}

The real goal is obtaining binaries that can be trusted to
do what the source code says they should do.  The other
property of tamper proof software is that the source code
is published, so the world can see what it does and look
for flaws.

The simplest tamper proof programming language is a straight
forward simple assembly language.  Given this, one can write
an interpreter for a simple interpreted language in the
assembly language.  The interpreted language should suffice
for most of the code, and can be machine independent.
A few functions can be optimized by being written in assembly
language.

\section{Software Distribution}

In addition to producing binaries that can be trusted, one
must distribute them.  The software for one of the E-Election
System machines will be a set of read-only files, one of which will be
the boot file that runs during startup.

The files and the
and their cryptographic signatures will be available on multiple
web sites.  Only the signature of the boot file needs to be checked,
as it will contain signatures of the other files and will check
the other files before they are used in running the machine.
Widely available commodity software running under commodity operating systems
can be used to check the signature of the boot file.

To avoid hacking by commodity software during a signature check,
the E-Election Machine thumb drive should have a physical read-only
switch.

The software files will be on
the same thumb drive as their associated machine's locked box, and
therefore cannot be substituted by switching thumb drives.

Private Voting Machines would be created by the town clerk.
Software updates for the Private Voting Machines are distributed
by the Registration Machines.  Therefore Private Voting Machines
would only need to have their file signatures checked if the voter
suspected that someone physically tampered with the machine's thumb drive.



\section{Keys and Names}

Each locked box in the system has a passkey, which is
written on a registration card associated with the locked
box.  Passkeys are generated by the system, and not by
people.  Typical passkeys consist of 2 or 3 pseudo-words
and 4 to 6 digits, chosen at random.  An example is
`vox64bam45zip01'.  A pseudo-word is equivalent to 3
digits, so this example is the equivalent of 15 random
digits, but the pseudo-words if chosen to be pronouncable
tend to make the passkey easier to type.

Each machine has a locked box.  Each precinct
has 10 additional locked M-Boxes.

Each machine and each M-Box has a public key and a private key.  These
are long, e.g. 4,096 bit, values constructed randomly
in public/private pairs.
These are \underline{not} the same as the passkey of any locked box.
Passkeys are symmetric encryption keys.

Each Machine
has a Unique ID, or UID, which is a 1024 bit random number
used to identify the machine.  This UID serves as the
machine's name.

Each M-box for a precinct and election has a number from 1 though 10.

Each Registration and Collection Machine has a URL.

The correspondence between Private Voting Machine UIDs
and voter names and addresses is not part of the E-Election system
described here.  The E-Election system only knows about
Private Voting Machines identified by their UIDs.
Generally the correspondence between UIDs and voter names and addresses
would only be made available
to organizations and people authorized by state law.
For example, Massachusetts currently makes voter registration lists
available to registered political parties.

When one machine sends a message to another, the sender
encrypts the message proper with the sender's private
key, and attaches the unencrypted sender's UID to the
message.  Then the sender encrypts the message with the
reciever's public key.  The sender must have the reciever's
public key, and the receiver must have the sender's public
key.  Public keys are not published,
though the system is designed so that publishing public
keys will not compromise security or essentual privacy,
and a voter can find out the public keys of Registration
Machines and Collection Machines by examining his/her locked
box using deviant software to decrypt and
display the locked box \pagref{DEVIANT-SOFTWARE}.

Note that Counting Machines are never given Private Voting
Machine UIDs or public keys, and can never associate an
encrypted ballot with a particular Private Voting Machine.

\section{Registration Machine Details}

A Registration Machine is run by a single election official
who holds the registration card containing the the passkey to
the machine's locked box.  The Registration Machine in this
sense is specific to a particular election, but the
URL naming the Registration Machine and the machine's
public/private key pair will typically remain the same across
several elections.

The locked box of a Registration Machine contains:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The private key of the Registration Machine.
\item Public keys of all Registration Machines, all Collection
Machines, and all M-Boxes.
\item Machine UIDs and URLs of all Registration Machines and all Collection
Machines.
\item The unmarked ballot.
\item UIDs and associated public keys of all Private Voting
Machines.  This includes de-registered and test Private Voting
Machines, as Registration Machines do not know which Private Voting
Machines are de-registered or test machines.
\item A log of any transactions the Registration Machine has
been involved in, including  Certificates issued by the Registration Machine.
Private Voting Machines are identified by their UID and not by the
name/address of their voter.

During the election the portion of the log involving transactions with
a particular Private Voting Machine is visible to that Private Voting
Machine.  \underline{After} the election the entire log will be available to
to the public under the same terms as voter registration lists are
available (e.g., in Massachusetts they are available to registered
political parties).
\item Information about Private Voting Machine Software, including
complete copies of recent versions, and version numbers and signatures of both
recent and deprecated versions.
\item UIDs, URLs, and public keys of Registration Machines that will be used
in future elections and Registration Machines that were used in previous
elections and have been removed from service.
\end{enumerate}

A Registration Machine receives four kinds of requests from
Private Voting Machines:
\begin{enumerate}

\item
Request for Ballot.  The reply includes the unmarked ballot
and any public keys and names of Registration and
Collection Machines known to the Registration Machine,
and also the public keys of any M-Boxes known to the Registration
Machine.

The reply also contains version numbers and signatures of Private
Voting Machine software known to the Registration Machine, and
the status of each version, active or deprecated.

The reply further contains the UIDs, URLs, and public keys of
Registration Machines not being used in the current election,
either because they have been removed from service or because
they will be used in a future election.  The status of each such
machine is included.

\item
Request for Certificate.  The request includes the signature
of an encrypted ballot prepared by the requesting Private
Voting Machine.  The reply is a certificate containing
the signature, the Private Voting Machine's UID,
and a signature of the certificate by the Registation Machine.

\item
Request for Log.  The log entries created by requests from the
requesting Private Voting Machine are returned in the reply.

\item
Request for Software.  The version of Private Voting Machine software
requested in returned in the reply.\footnote{It may be necessary to
modularize the software so that individual device drivers and
the election software proper are separate modules.  Given this no module
should be more than several megabytes in size.  If devices are sufficiently
standardized this will not be necessary.}

\end{enumerate}

Requesters are always Private Voting Machines, and all replies
are sent to just the requester.  All requests are logged.

A Registration Machine may serve requests from more than
one precinct, but the election information flow remains specific
to the precinct.  Each precinct should have at least 3
Registration Machines available.

Note that Private Voting Machines have no concept of time.
If they cannot contact Registation Machines used in the last
election, they will try to contact Registration Machines
slated for use in future elections, and if successful, will
update their locked box according the Request for Ballot
replies of these Registration Machines.

\section{Private Voting Machine Details}

A Private Voting Machine is run by a single voter
who holds the registration card containing the passkey to
the machine's locked box.  Usually a Private Voting Machine
is used by its voter for multiple elections over a period
of several years, after which the Private Voting Machine
is de-registered and a new Private Voting Machine
is given to the voter.

Initially the locked box of a Private Voting Machine contains:
\newcounter{PVM-COUNTER}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The UID of the Private Voting Machine.
\item The public and private key of the Private Voting Machine.
\item Public keys, UIDs, URLs, and status of some Registration Machines.
\item Version number and signature of Private Voting Machine's current
      software.
\setcounter{PVM-COUNTER}{\value{enumi}}
\end{enumerate}

The Private Voting Machine
makes requests of Registration Machines.  In every case
at least 3 Registration Machines should be used and the
results compared or tabulated to avoid single point failures or corruption.

The first thing a Private Voting Machine does, when prompted by
its voter, is make a Request for Ballot and use the replies to
add to its locked box the following information:
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{\value{PVM-COUNTER}}
\item URLs, public keys, and UIDs
of all Registration Machines and all Collection
Machines used in the current election.
\item Public keys the M-Boxes used in the current election.
\item The unmarked ballot.
\item UIDs, public keys, and URLs of Registration Machines that are
obsolete or will be used in future elections.
\item Version numbers and signatures of different sofware versions
known to the Registration Machines.
\end{enumerate}
This can be done days or just minutes before the voter votes.

At this point
the voter may or may not choose to update Private Voting Machine
software using a Request for Sofware made to the Registration Machines.

The next step is for the voter to vote by marking the ballot.

After it is marked the ballot is encrypted and certified.  Encryption of the
ballot is described below.  To certify the ballot, a signature
is computed of the encrypted ballot, and the signature is sent
in a Request to Certify message to each of at least three Registration
Machines.  These in turn send back certificates that are appended
to the encrypted ballot to form the submitted ballot.  Each
certificate contains the signature of the encrypted ballot, the
UIDs of the Private Voting Machine and Registration Machine,
and a time stamp.  The certificates
are signed by the Registration Machines but are \underline{not} encrypted.
The certificates are copied to the Registration Machine log, and can be
be viewed by the public.

The submitted ballot is now sent by the Private Voting
Machine to at least three Collection Machines.  The submitted
ballot contains:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The encrypted ballot.
\item Certificates received for the encrypted ballot.  Each contains the
UIDs of the Private Voting Machine and certifying Registation Machine.
\item A copy of the unencrypted \underline{unmarked} ballot, for
diagnostic purposes.
\item Version number of the Private Voting Machine software, for
diagnostic purposes.
\end{enumerate}


A voter may change her/his mind and re-vote.  The last ballot
he/she casts counts.  This is rather important in an election,
as on the one hand a voter may receive new information and
want to change the vote, and on the other hand to avoid system
congestion it is convenient to have votes strung out over time.

\section{Ballot Encryption Details}

The ballot is encrypted as follows.

First, the ballot is randomized by a process something like
the following.  A long random number is generated.  The first
part is used as instructions to place the ballot voting bits in
various random places in the second part of the random number
(ballots have very voting few bits).

Second, a random symmetric key S is generated and used to encrypt
the randomized ballot.  Then 10 more random keys K1, ..., K10 are generated
and used in 5-way Shamir Secret Sharing encryption
scheme to encrypt S.  The 5-way
scheme is such that any 5 of the 10 K-keys can decrypt the encrypted S.
Then each of the 10 K-keys is encrypted by the public key
of a different one of the 10 M-boxes.

The encrypted ballot consists of the randomized encrypted ballot proper,
the encripted key S, the 10 encrypted K-Keys, and for
diagnostic purposes, a copy of the unencrypted, unmarked ballot.  The
encrypted ballot can be decrypted
by any 5 M-boxes.  It does \underline{not} contain the voter's ID.

\section{Certificate Details}

For each encrypted ballot, several certificates are generated
by Registration Machines acting independently.  Each certificate
contains:
\begin{enumerate}
\item UID of the Private Voting Machine submitting the encrypted ballot.
\item UID of the Registration Machine certifying the ballot.
\item Date and time, as computed by the Registration Machine.
\item Signature of the encrypted ballot as computed by the
      Private Voting Machine.  The encrypted ballot itself is
      \underline{never} sent to the Registration Machine.
\item Signature of the certificate computed using the private key of
the Registration Machine.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Collection Machine Details}

The Collection Machines receive the submitted ballots, each containing
an encrypted ballot and at least 3 certificates for the encrypted
ballot.

The locked box of a Collection Machine contains:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The private key of the Collection Machine.
\item Public keys and UIDs of all Registration Machines and all Collection
Machines.
\item The unmarked ballot.
\item UIDs and associated public keys of all Private Voting
Machines.  This includes de-registered and test Private Voting
Machines, as Collection Machines do not initially know which Private Voting
Machines are de-registered or test machines.
\item The set of all accepted submitted ballots sent to the collection machine
by Private Voting Machines.
\end{enumerate}

Collection Machines receive and process two kinds of requests from
Private Voting Machines:
\begin{enumerate}

\item
Ballot Submission.  The Private Voting Machine uses this to sent
its submitted ballot to the Collection Machine.  The latter accepts
the submitted ballot if its Registration Machine certificate signatures
and the enclosed unmarked ballot check, and rejects the submitted
ballot otherwise.  Note that a message not correctly encrypted with
the private key of the submitting Private Voting Machine is ignored.

Accepted submitted ballots are added to the locked box of the
Collection Machine.

\item
Submission Check.  The Collection Machine sends a reply containing
the certificates of accepted submitted ballots
that were sent to the Collection Machine
by the Private Voting Machine, if any.

\end{enumerate}

At the end of voting Collection Machines are disconnected from
the internet.  They then
\begin{enumerate}
\item Transmit to each other their sets of accepted submitted ballots.
\item Merge into their own set of accepted submitted ballots any
received from other Collection Machines that they did not have previously.
At this point, all Collection Machines have the same set of accepted
submitted ballots.
\item Receive from outside the E-Election System a list of de-registered
and test Private Voting Machines.
\item Create a set of valid ballots (defined below)
which are to be submitted to the Counting Machines.
\item Separated this set of valid ballots into a set of ballot headers
and a set of encrypted ballots.  The header of a submitted ballot is
everything but the encrypted ballot contained therein.  In particular
the certificates are in the header.
\item Transfer the set of encrypted ballots to each Counting Machine.
\end{enumerate}

Since the Collection Machines are disconnected from the internet,
data transfers are made by copying to and from thumb drives, or by
a network physically separate from the internet.

A ballot is valid unless:

\begin{enumerate}
\item It has been superceded by a later ballot from the same
Private Voting Machine.
\item It is from a Private Voting Machine that has been de-registered
\pagref{DE-REGISTERED}.
\item It is from a test Private Voting Machine that is
being used as a system/hardware tester \pagref{TESTER}.
\end{enumerate}

Note that messages received that cannot be decrypted using the
private key of the Collection Machine
are discarded, and so cannot contain
ballots that are either valid or invalid.  Collection Machine
public/private key pairs are election specific, so ballots for
the wrong election will not be considered.

\section{Counting Machine Details}

Counting Machines recieve a complete set of encrypted ballots
from each collection machine, and check to be sure these sets
are the same for each Counting Machine.

Each Counting Machine is then given 5 M-boxes and proceeds to
decrypt and count the ballots.

The Counting Machine locked box contains nothing but the UIDs
and public keys of all Collection Machines, and a log of all
the final results (including recounts).

An M-box contains nothing but its number (1 though 10)
and the private key of the M-box.

Write-ins can be tabulated by the Counting Machines in a manner
generally similar to regular votes.  A write-in is a piece of
text, and counts can be given each piece of text and for groups
of similar pieces of text.

\section{De-Registration}

If a Private Voting Machine (i.e., its thumb drive and registration
card) is lost or stolen, the voter may have the machine
de-registered\label{DE-REGISTERED}
and replaced by a new Private Voting Machine.

\section{Testing}

Some Private Voting Machines are used as `testers'\label{TESTER} for
system software and hardware.
These are used by election officials to cast known votes that can
be checked to ensure that the system and hardware is working as
desired.

To check test votes, a test-re-count is conducted in which
the Collection Machines are told that the test Private Voting
Machines are valid: i.e., not test and not de-registered.  The
test recount should produces counts whose difference exactly
equals the votes of the test machines, which can be recorded on
paper when the test administrators use them to vote.  If there
is a slight mismatch, the test ballots can be counted by themselves
by the Collection/Counting machines.  Furthermore, a Counting Machine
can display a ballot, since all association with a voter has been
removed, so the test ballots can be displayed if necessary to
resolve discrepancies introduces by minor election official error.

The testing procedure involves running Machines on the same kinds
of hardware that would be used in non-test voting and counting,
in a way that the software and hardware of these machines has no
way of knowing that they are being run as tests.  In particular, if a
hardware manufacturer is producing hacked hardware that corrupts
ballots or counting, this will be eventually detected.

\section{Vote Buying}

No voting system prevents a person who knows a voter well from
`buying' the voter's vote with some favor.

However buying votes on a large enough scale to influence elections
is difficult to do without being detected and prosecuted.
This is just as true of our proposed E-Election System as of
current voting systems.

The only thing easier to do in the E-Election System is verification
that a vote bought from a stranger
is what the buyer wants it to be.  The E-Election
System shares this with absentee voting systems.  However, since its
nearly impossible to buy large numbers of votes without being detected,
such easier verification is not significant.

\section{Voter Suppression}

Attempts to suppress votes are more common that attempts to buy votes.

Using Registration Machines to distribute updates for Registration
Machine lists and software should make voter suppression very difficult.
It would probably be a good idea, however, to have each voter come into
the voter registration office once every 5 years to get a new
Private Voting Machine, at which time their old one is de-registered.


\section{Deviant Software}
\label{DEVIANT-SOFTWARE}

Since the software is published and compilers for its tamper-proof
language are to be readily available, it is easy to make deviant
versions of the software.

To keep such versions out of the system, the sofware should be
placed on the same thumb drives as the locked boxes which the
software will be used with.  In addition signatures of the
software can be place in the locked boxes, and other independent
software can be used to open the locked box and validate the
thumb drive software.

Using duplicated Registration Machines to distribute software updates should
make if nearly impossible for hackers
to introduce deviant software on a large scale.
