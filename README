The E-Election System is a system for holding
all-electronic elections.

The voter is given a thumb drive which functions like a
computer: it is used instead of the computer's hard disk
when it is run on a computer.  This is combined with
tamper-proof software and a virtual private network
whose keys are delivered via thumb drives and NOT copied
over the internet to make a completely electronic secure
election system.

The e-election.pdf file is a preliminary design for such
a system.  The author does not intend to implement the
system.  See the e-election.pdf footnotes for more
status information.
